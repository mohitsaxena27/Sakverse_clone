Before responding, think step-by-step through the story to understand:
- What are the key functionalities mentioned?
- What are the business rules, conditions, or validations?
- What roles are involved and what actions they can perform?
- What input data or variations might be needed?

**Instructions for Response:**
###IMPORTANT
1. Return your output strictly in the following JSON schema after you complete you thinking and reasoning:
```json
{{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "title": "FunctionalityList",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {{
    "functionalities": {{

      "minItems": 1
    }}
  }},
  "required": ["functionalities"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}}
```

**Rules for Output:**
1. Do NOT include any commentary or extra explanation.
2. Each functionality must be a complete sentence or detailed string.
3. Only include core, testable functionalities — no UI labels or layout references unless critical.
4. Do not repeat or paraphrase the story. Abstract and group similar actions together.

Now, here is the user story for analysis:

        - Do NOT return any item where either field is empty, null, a placeholder, or whitespace.
        - Do NOT include incomplete entries for example : {{' ': 'why'}} or {{' ': 'question'}} or {{'question ': ''}} or {{'why ': ''}} or {{" ": " "}}.
