    # Given I am a support user if the tenant has e-Learning Advanced radio button on, then I can select other e-Learning permissions (course admin, assignment manager, regular user) and the lite permission will be hidden.
    # Given I am a support user if I turn the toggle off for e-Learning at the tenant level, all users should have their Lite Permission removed.
    # As a course admin, assignment manager or regular user with e-Learning advanced on, I should still be able to view the webcasts and watch them.
    # Given I am a Line Manager the description of the role should be updated to remove the / and swap it to a '

    # As an e-Learning Lite user I need to be subscribed that permission so I can use e-Learning Lite
    # In scope:
    # When a tenant is created and e learning lite is on, all users for that tenant should be given the same permission called Lite Permission
    # The e -Learning Lite permission is the same permissions as a regular user. It will be displayed user the regular user permission.
    # The e-Learning Lite users only have this one permission, so we should disable or hide the other e-Learning permissions. Users of e-Learning lite will not be able to have course admins, assignment managers. Only if they are a paying e-Learning customer will they be able to select the roles (regular user, course admin, assignment manager)
    # Permission name: Lite User
    # Permission Description: Employees of the company who are not subscribed to the e-learning module, but have access to e-Learning Lite. This permission allows them to watch the ACA Webcasts within ComplianceAlpha.
    # If support turns of e-Learning lite for the tenant, then the permissions for all users in the tenant will be removed, and they can no longer see e-Learning lite.
    # Course admins, assignment managers and regular users for e-Learning advanced will still be able to view the webcasts and watch them without being assigned.

    # Fix the typo on the line manager role. Should read: “Line Manager on the user’s profile” and not /

    # Technical Details
    # Objective
    # The script adds a new Lite User role and associated permissions to specific clients in the LMS platform. It ensures proper permission management and grants access based on defined roles and features.
    # ________________________________________
    # Steps and Technical Details
    # 1.	Initialization
    # o	Identifiers, feature names, roles, and permission details are declared and initialized.
    # o	Parameters include:
    # 	@LMSProductKey, @LMSProductId: Identify the LMS Product.
    # 	Role and permission-specific parameters like @ElearningLightRoleId, @ElearningLiteUserPermissionId, etc.
    # 2.	Role Creation for ACA Group Clients
    # o	A new Lite User role (role_eLearning_lite_user) is created for ACA group clients.
    # o	If the role does not already exist, it is inserted into [Authorization].[Role].
    # 3.	Role Addition for Non-ACA Clients
    # o	The Lite User role is inserted for other clients based on specific conditions:
    # 	Clients must not belong to ACA.
    # 	The role must not already exist for the client.
    # 4.	Permission Management
    # o	A new permission (ELearningLiteUser) is added to [Authorization].[Permission] if it does not exist.
    # o	This permission is linked to the LMS module in [Authorization].[PermissionModule].
    # 5.	Grant Type Management
    # o	Grant types for permissions (e.g., View, Create, Update, Delete) are managed in [Authorization].[PermissionGrantType].
    # 6.	Permission-Feature Mapping
    # o	Permissions are mapped to LMS features (e-Learning Lite, e-Learning Advanced) in [Authorization].[PermissionProductFeature].
    # o	The mapping includes various grant types (View, Create, Update, Delete).
    # 7.	Role-Permission Mapping
    # o	The new Lite User role is linked to the ELearningLiteUser permission in [Authorization].[RolePermission].
    # 8.	Transaction Management
    # o	The script uses a TRY-CATCH block to ensure robust error handling.
    # o	Transactions are committed or rolled back based on the success or failure of the operations.
    #
    # Error Handling
    # •	Errors are captured in the CATCH block and logged with details like error number, procedure, message, and script reference (AGP-9953).
    # •	Any failed transactions are rolled back to maintain database integrity.
    # Key Tables Modified
    # •	[Authorization].[Role]

   ### 🧹 Deduplication & Merging Rules

            To maintain clarity and avoid redundancy:

            - ❌ **Do not create features which is sharing the common test objective and result in creating duplicate test cases** when different techniques yield similar outcome or data sets.
            - ✅ **Merge features ** that cover the same objective, even if derived from different techniques and data sets.
            - 📌 **Each features contribute unique functionality coverage** (e.g., a new value range, rule, or flow).
            - 🧠 Use reasoning to **consolidate** and **annotate** features to reflect **combined coverage** where applicable.
            - ❌ **Do not create scenarios which objective is to test same functionality but different data sets becaue this may create duplicate test cases** when different techniques yield similar or overlapping data sets merege.
            - ✅ **Merge scenarios** that cover the same objective, even if derived from different techniques and data sets.
            - 📌 **Each scenarios must contribute unique test coverage** (e.g., a new value range, rule,flow or different data combinations).
            - 🧠 Use reasoning to **consolidate** and **annotate** scenarios to reflect **combined coverage** where applicable.

    **Instructions for Response:**
    ###IMPORTANT
    Return your output strictly in the following JSON schema after you complete you thinking and reasoning:
    ```json

    - Do NOT include markdown, code blocks, opening/closing statements, or explanations.
    - Ensure the output is valid JSON and can be parsed without error.
    - Do not include fields like "$schema", "title", "type", or "properties".
    - You must only return a JSON **data object** that conforms to the expected structure — NOT a schema definition.

    Begin your analysis and return the JSON output based on the following task:

            ---

            ### 🎯 Input Context

            - 📌 **Requirement Description**: {task_description}
            - 🛠️ **Action to be Performed**: {task}
            - 📘 **Test Design Technique Applied**: {activity['activity']}

            ---

            ### 🧠 Responsibilities

            1. Analyze the requirement deeply to identify:
               - Input fields and data ranges
               - Business logic, rules, decisions
               - States and transitions (if any)
               - User actions and flows
               - System validations and boundaries

            2. Apply the given test design technique to derive test cases:
               - **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**
               - **Equivalence Partitioning (EP)**
               - **Decision Table Testing**
               - **State Transition Diagrams (STD)**
               - **Use Case Testing**

            3. Ensure:
               - ✅ All valid and invalid partitions are covered
               - ✅ Boundaries and limits are tested
               - ✅ Every business rule or decision is represented
               - ✅ State transitions (if applicable) are exercised
               - ✅ End-to-end user flows are covered

            ---

            ### 🧹 Deduplication & Merging Rules

            To maintain clarity and avoid redundancy:

            - ❌ **DO NOT create duplicate test cases** when different techniques yield similar or overlapping data sets.
            - ✅ **Merge test cases** that cover the same objective or scenario, even if derived from different techniques.
            - 📌 **Each test case must add unique test coverage** (e.g., a new value range, rule, or flow).
            - 🧠 Use reasoning to **consolidate** and **annotate** test cases to reflect **combined coverage** where applicable.

            ---

            📦 ATTRIBUTE DEFINITIONS
            **priority** Only P1, P2, P3 possible values could be based below definations:
             - P1 (High): Core business flow, critical, compliance-driven, high failure risk
             - P2 (Medium): Frequently used but not business-blocking
             - P3 (Low): Informational, cosmetic, or rarely used features

            **to_be_automated**:
            Set to true if: 
             - The test is stable, repeatable, and frequently executed (e.g., login, API validation, calculation rules)
             - It has deterministic outcomes and adds value to regression suites
            Else, set to false (e.g., visual layout, one-time UX checks)

            🔐 Constraints
                - Do not include markdown, headers, or comments
                - Return only JSON output
                - Follow Pydantic model constraints exactly
                - Ensure each test case is unique, atomic, and covers a distinct rule/path/condition
                - Think systematically and logically before generating

            🔁 Think step-by-step before generating:
                - Identify inputs, outputs, and business conditions
                - Derive partitions, boundaries, decisions, or transitions based on the selected technique
                - Validate what is automatable and what isn’t
                - Based on give definition analyse the priority
                - Tag test cases for easy traceability and test planning

            ### 🧪 Coverage Guarantee Checklist (AI should implicitly reason through these)

                - ✅ Valid inputs
                - ✅ Invalid inputs
                - ✅ Edge boundaries
                - ✅ Decision combinations
                - ✅ State transitions
                - ✅ Workflow validations
                - ✅ Negative flows
                - ✅ Automation feasibility
                - ✅ Business risk-based prioritization
